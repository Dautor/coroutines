* Examples
Examples can be found under directory =example=.

Currently there are 3 example programs:
- yield

  Shows some computation within coroutines and uses =yield= to make them concurent.
- server

  Implementation of a simple TCP server using this coroutine library.
  - supports an "infinite" amount of clients.
  - just broadcasts messages to all clients
- client

  Implementation of a simple TCP client using this coroutine library.
  - can connect to the example server and send/receive messages

* Why C++?
Unfortunately, this library is not implementable in C.
It is _almost_ implementable, except for the simple syntax of =CO=.
It would be implementable if we had =vmakecontext= (a variant of =makecontext= that takes in =va_list= instead of =...=). If someone provides it, I will port the library to C.
